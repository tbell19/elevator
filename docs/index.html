                    <h3>The Elevator I Chose</h3>
                    <p>I chose the elevators closest to the enterance of the Texas Tech Library</p>
                    <p>The current design is a little busy and has a confusing button layout.</p>
                    <p>There are only four floors so there is no reason why the buttons cannot be stacked vertically.</p>
                    <p>Currently it is not intuitive to find the button for the floor that you are trying to go to with the buttons
                        staggered left and right.
                    </p>
                    <p>The elevator has lots of information but it is displayed in a way which can be overwhelming when trying to make a quick glance</p>
                    <p>There is very little seperation the buttons which are used often and the buttons which are only used in emergency situations</p>
                    <h3>About this Elevator</h3>
                    <p>This elevator is commonly used for</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Taking students between floors</li>
                        <li>Transferring books and equipment between floors</li>
                        <li>Providing information about the library</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Uncommon uses for this elevator</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Emergency use by firefighters</li>
                        <li>Calling for help in the event of a malfunction</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>A typical interaction with this elevator would be a person entering, pressing the button for their selected floor and waiting for it to arrive.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center">Original Design</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The original design has a list of the things on each floor surrounding the buttons which is overwhelmin</li>
                        <li>The elevator uses the intuitive nature of pressing the button next to the floor name to support the user figuring
                            out how to use it on their own; however, the spacing and layout of buttons could make this confusing.
                        </li>
                        <li>The elevator gives feedback via beeps and the tactile feel of the buttons.</li>
                        <li>Some common mistakes that can be made while designing an elevator is not putting the buttons in an order that makes sense,
                            this elevator I believe has that mistake.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="text-center">My Design</h3>
                    <ul>
                        
                        <li>
                        My design features a less cluttered screen which shows information for only the current floor.
                        </li> 
                        <li>My elevator also uses the intuitive nature of pressing buttons which are labeled with their corresponding floor,
                        however my buttons are layed out with the floor buttons stacked vertically on the left side and with extra buttons which are not used
                        often on the right.
                        </li>
                        <li>My elevator gives feedback via beeps and the tactile feel of the buttons, but also features additional information on the screen.</li>
                        <li>I believe my elevator avoids many common design mistakes and provides an intuitive experience for users.</li>
